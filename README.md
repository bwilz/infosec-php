# infosec-php
This is for a fullstack php/js demonstration

In order to get this working I had to do a fresh install of PHP and enable cURL and add a certificate so restcountries would respond to me.

Start the PHP server with 'php -S localhost:8000 -t ../' from the PHP directory. The page is then (obviously) at localhost:8000.

Overall this test was fun. I wasted some time by using a Windows machine that had nothing set up on it, and I feel like I could spend a bit more time on it cleaning some of the code up and making the front end look nicer.
